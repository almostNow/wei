## WEI Problem 2 Solution
Create a CLI script in Python that audits all the VMs in a single AWS Region or list of AWS.
Regions passed as an argument for their attached disks and the sizes of the attached
disks and writes this information out to a nicely formatted Excel file

### Usage
```sh
python3 ./get_disks_by_region.py -r|--region AWS_region_name
```
An AWS_region_name example would be *us-east-2*
